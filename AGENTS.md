## Recent Work (Last Session - Nov 4, 2025, Session 29)

### Docker PUID/PGID Support - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Created docker-entrypoint.sh script for dynamic user/group ID management
- ✅ Modified Dockerfile to use entrypoint wrapper instead of direct binary execution
- ✅ Added shadow package for usermod/groupmod commands
- ✅ Implemented PUID/PGID environment variable support (defaults to 1000:1000)
- ✅ Simplified entrypoint using usermod/groupmod approach (Linuxserver.io pattern)
- ✅ Automatic ownership fixes only when IDs change from defaults
- ✅ Enhanced NAS_DEPLOYMENT.md with improved Docker build instructions
- ✅ Tested successfully with custom user IDs (1001:1001) and defaults (1000:1000)
- ✅ All 394 tests still passing

**Problem Solved:**
- Docker containers need to match host system file permissions for media access
- NAS systems (Synology, QNAP) use custom user/group IDs (e.g., 1027:65536)
- Fixed permissions required for symlink creation and media file access
- Previous implementation ran as fixed UID/GID 1000, causing permission errors

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `/docker-entrypoint.sh` script (18 lines, simplified from initial 34-line version)
- Container starts as root to allow user/group modification
- Uses `usermod -o` and `groupmod -o` to change IDs (allows duplicate IDs)
- Only runs ownership fix when IDs differ from defaults (performance optimization)
- Switches to prunarr user via `su-exec` before starting application
- **Simplified approach**: No user deletion/recreation (more reliable and cleaner)

**Dockerfile Changes:**
- Line 45: Added `shadow` package for usermod/groupmod commands
- Line 64-65: Copy entrypoint script and make executable
- Line 72-73: Removed `USER prunarr` directive (must start as root)
- Line 90: Changed ENTRYPOINT to `/docker-entrypoint.sh`
- Line 91: Changed CMD to pass prunarr binary and args to entrypoint

**Entrypoint Script Features (Simplified):**
```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
PUID=${PUID:-1000}
PGID=${PGID:-1000}
groupmod -o -g "$PGID" prunarr
usermod -o -u "$PUID" prunarr
if [ "$PUID" != "1000" ] || [ "$PGID" != "1000" ]; then
    echo "Setting ownership to $PUID:$PGID..."
    chown -R prunarr:prunarr /app
fi
exec su-exec prunarr "$@"
```

**Key Design Decision:**
- Initial implementation used complex `deluser`/`delgroup`/`adduser`/`addgroup` logic
- **Simplified to Linuxserver.io approach**: Use `usermod -o` and `groupmod -o`
- Advantages: More reliable, cleaner code, fewer potential errors
- The `-o` flag allows duplicate UIDs/GIDs which is exactly what we need

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `Dockerfile` (+18 lines, -10 lines) - Entrypoint integration, package additions
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` - NEW (18 lines) - PUID/PGID management script (simplified)
- `NAS_DEPLOYMENT.md` (+35 lines, -4 lines) - Enhanced Docker build docs

**Commits:**
1. `ec2c14f` - feat: add PUID/PGID support for Docker container user management (amended with simplified version)

**Current State:**
- Running: No (Docker image built for testing)
- Tests passing: 394/394 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Docker image: Builds successfully (~XX MB)
- PUID/PGID: Tested and working ✅

**Usage Example:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  prunarr:
    image: prunarr:latest
    environment:
      - PUID=1027        # Your NAS user ID
      - PGID=65536       # Your NAS group ID
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    volumes:
      - /volume3/docker/prunarr/prunarr.yaml:/app/config/prunarr.yaml
      - /volume3/docker/prunarr/data:/app/data
      - /volume1/data:/data:ro
```

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Container starts with default PUID=1000, PGID=1000
- ✅ User/group recreation works with custom IDs (1001:1001 tested)
- ✅ Directory ownership updated correctly after ID changes
- ✅ Application runs as non-root user after entrypoint setup
- ✅ All functionality preserved (394 tests passing)

**Key Benefits:**
1. **NAS Compatibility**: Works with Synology, QNAP, UnRAID custom user IDs
2. **Flexible Permissions**: Match host system ownership for media access
3. **Security**: Runs as non-root user after initialization
4. **Zero Config**: Defaults to 1000:1000 for standard Docker setups
5. **Dynamic**: No image rebuild required to change user IDs

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Test Docker deployment on actual NAS system
- [ ] Verify symlink creation works with custom PUID/PGID
- [ ] Validate Jellyfin library access through symlinks
- [ ] Update main README.md with Docker deployment instructions
- [ ] Consider adding UMASK environment variable support
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements

**Key Lessons:**
1. **User management order**: Must delete user before deleting group (Alpine Linux)
2. **Error suppression**: Use `2>/dev/null || true` for idempotent operations
3. **Root requirement**: Container must start as root to modify user/group IDs
4. **su-exec vs gosu**: Alpine uses su-exec (lighter weight, same functionality)
5. **Ownership timing**: Fix directory ownership AFTER user/group recreation
6. **Docker permissions**: setgroups errors in unprivileged mode are expected/harmless
7. **Entrypoint design**: Entrypoint wraps application, CMD provides default args

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 28)

### Symlink Library Manager Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Implemented complete SymlinkLibraryManager service (384 lines)
- ✅ Created Jellyfin Virtual Folder API methods (GET, CREATE, DELETE)
- ✅ Integrated symlink library sync into FullSync workflow
- ✅ Updated configuration structures and validation
- ✅ Replaced Collections config with SymlinkLibrary in example config
- ✅ Deleted old collection files (jellyfin_collections.go + test file)
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests (13 test cases, 661 lines)
- ✅ Fixed bugs discovered during testing (JellyfinID validation, source file checks)
- ✅ All 394 tests passing (381 existing + 13 new)
- ✅ Binary builds successfully (14MB)

**Decision Reversal:**
- Session 27: Decided to keep Collections for v1.0 (defer symlinks to v2.0)
- Session 28: **Implemented symlink libraries immediately** (better UX wins)
- Rationale: Better sidebar visibility outweighs setup complexity

**Implementation Details:**

**New SymlinkLibraryManager Service:**
- `SyncLibraries()` - Main orchestration (called after retention rules in FullSync)
- `filterScheduledMedia()` - Separate movies/TV with future deletion dates
- `syncLibrary()` - Sync individual library (create folder, symlinks, cleanup)
- `ensureVirtualFolder()` - Manage Jellyfin libraries via Virtual Folder API
- `ensureDirectory()` - Create symlink base directories
- `createSymlinks()` - Create filesystem symlinks to actual media files
- `cleanupSymlinks()` - Remove stale symlinks for unscheduled items
- `generateSymlinkName()` - Safe filename generation from metadata
- Full dry-run support throughout all operations

**Jellyfin Client Enhancements:**
- `GetVirtualFolders()` - List existing libraries
- `CreateVirtualFolder(name, collectionType, paths, dryRun)` - Create library
- `DeleteVirtualFolder(name, dryRun)` - Remove library
- All methods respect dry-run mode

**Configuration Changes:**
- NEW: `SymlinkLibraryConfig` struct (enabled, base_path, movies, tv_shows)
- Deleted: `JellyfinCollectionsConfig` (replaced entirely)
- Validation: Check base_path writability, library names, collection types
- Example config: Added Docker volume mapping examples and path translation docs

**Sync Integration:**
- Added `symlinkLibraryManager` field to SyncEngine
- Initialize when `SymlinkLibrary.Enabled` is true
- Call `SyncLibraries()` in FullSync after `applyRetentionRules()`
- Thread-safe: Copy media library with RLock before async operations

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `internal/services/symlink_library.go` - NEW (384 lines)
- `internal/clients/jellyfin.go` - Virtual Folder API methods (+208 lines)
- `internal/clients/types.go` - VirtualFolder structs (+32 lines)
- `internal/config/types.go` - SymlinkLibraryConfig (+27 lines)
- `internal/config/validation.go` - Symlink validation (+34 lines)
- `internal/services/sync.go` - Integration (+42 lines)
- `internal/api/handlers/config.go` - Config handler updates (+38 lines)
- `config/prunarr.yaml.example` - Symlink config docs (+28 lines)
- DELETED: `internal/services/jellyfin_collections.go` (-194 lines)
- DELETED: `internal/services/jellyfin_collections_test.go` (-531 lines)

**Commits:**
1. `492cd6b` - feat: replace Collections with Symlink Library Manager for better visibility
2. `da211f5` - test: add comprehensive unit tests for SymlinkLibraryManager

**Current State:**
- Running: No (implementation complete, manual testing pending)
- Tests passing: 394/394 ✅ (381 existing + 13 new)
- Build: ✅ Successful (prunarr-symlink binary 14MB)
- Known issues: None
- Net change: +313 lines (1,243 added, 930 deleted)

**Advantages Over Collections:**
1. **Better Visibility** - Libraries appear in Jellyfin sidebar (not buried in Collections)
2. **User-Friendly** - More intuitive "Leaving Soon" section
3. **Proven Approach** - Janitorr uses this successfully
4. **Native Feel** - Works like regular Jellyfin libraries
5. **Cleaner Separation** - Movies and TV shows in separate libraries

**Requirements for Deployment:**
- Docker volume mapping for symlink directories required
- Both Prunarr and Jellyfin must see same media paths
- Symlink base directory must be writable by Prunarr container
- See `config/prunarr.yaml.example` for Docker Compose setup

**Unit Tests Added (13 test cases):**
- `TestNewSymlinkLibraryManager` - Constructor validation
- `TestFilterScheduledMedia` - 6 subtests for media filtering (types, exclusions, dates, IDs)
- `TestGenerateSymlinkName` - 2 subtests for safe filename generation
- `TestCreateSymlinks` - 3 subtests for symlink creation (success, dry-run, missing files)
- `TestCleanupSymlinks` - 2 subtests for stale symlink removal
- `TestEnsureVirtualFolder` - 4 subtests for Jellyfin library management
- `TestSyncLibraries_Integration` - End-to-end integration test

**Bug Fixes Discovered via Testing:**
- Fixed missing `JellyfinID` validation in `filterScheduledMedia()` (line 112-114)
- Fixed source file existence check in `createSymlinks()` (line 272-277)
- Fixed symlink tracking to only include successfully created symlinks (line 322)

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Manual testing with real Jellyfin instance (requires Docker setup)
- [ ] Verify symlink creation works correctly with real files
- [ ] Test Virtual Folder creation/deletion/updates with Jellyfin API
- [ ] Validate path translation in Docker environment
- [ ] Test edge cases: permission issues, concurrent syncs
- [ ] Update README/documentation with setup instructions
- [ ] Consider adding error recovery and retry logic if needed

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Bold decisions**: Sometimes the "defer to v2.0" choice should be reconsidered
2. **UX over complexity**: Better user experience justifies implementation complexity
3. **Code replacement**: Replacing 725 lines of old code with 1,045 lines of new code (384 implementation + 661 tests)
4. **API design**: Virtual Folder API is simpler than Collection item management
5. **Thread safety**: Always copy shared state before passing to async operations
6. **Interface design**: Local interfaces for dependency injection avoid global client changes
7. **Test-driven bug finding**: Unit tests discovered 3 bugs before manual testing
8. **Validation importance**: Always check JellyfinID existence and source file availability

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 27)

### Jellyfin Virtual Folder (Library) API Research - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Researched Jellyfin Virtual Folder API from official source code
- ✅ Documented all 6 API endpoints for library management
- ✅ Analyzed Janitorr's symlink library implementation approach
- ✅ Compared Collections (current) vs Virtual Folders (alternative)
- ✅ Evaluated implementation complexity and user setup requirements
- ✅ Created comprehensive research document (SESSION_27_JELLYFIN_LIBRARY_API.md)
- ✅ Made architectural decision: Keep collections for v1.0

**Research Findings:**

**Virtual Folder API Endpoints Discovered:**
1. `GET /Library/VirtualFolders` - List all libraries
2. `POST /Library/VirtualFolders` - Create library (with collectionType: movies/tvshows/music/etc.)
3. `DELETE /Library/VirtualFolders` - Delete library
4. `POST /Library/VirtualFolders/Name` - Rename library
5. `POST /Library/VirtualFolders/Paths` - Add path to library
6. `DELETE /Library/VirtualFolders/Paths` - Remove path from library

**Key Insights:**
- Virtual Folders (Libraries) appear in sidebar (better visibility than Collections)
- Janitorr uses symlinks to create "Leaving Soon" as a library (not collection)
- Requires filesystem access and complex Docker volume mapping
- Path translation needed between Prunarr/Jellyfin/Radarr/Sonarr containers
- Collections API already working perfectly (Sessions 7, 20)

**Decision Made:**
- **v1.0**: Keep current Collections approach (production-ready, simple setup)
- **v2.0**: Consider symlink libraries as optional enhancement
- **Rationale**: Avoid filesystem complexity, easier user setup, proven stable

**Files Created:**
- `SESSION_27_JELLYFIN_LIBRARY_API.md` - Complete research documentation with implementation plan

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (backend + frontend)
- Tests passing: 381/381 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Collections feature: ✅ Working and stable
- Symlink libraries: 🔬 Researched, deferred to v2.0

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Move to next priority feature: user-based cleanup or mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Consider user feedback on Collections visibility before v2.0 planning
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Research before coding**: Investigated API fully before implementation decision
2. **Simplicity wins**: Current Collections approach is simpler and production-ready
3. **Defer complexity**: Symlink libraries add filesystem/path mapping complexity
4. **User setup burden**: Virtual folders require complex Docker volume configuration
5. **Feature completeness**: Collections provide 100% functionality with better maintainability

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 20)

### Jellyfin Collections Dry-Run Bug Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed Jellyfin collections to respect config hot-reload for dry_run setting
- ✅ Removed dryRun field from JellyfinCollectionManager struct
- ✅ Implemented dynamic config reading at runtime with nil-safety (defaults to dry_run=true)
- ✅ Improved test safety by adding SetTestConfig() for in-memory test configs
- ✅ Eliminated live credential loading in tests (was using prunarr.test.yaml)
- ✅ All 381 tests passing (13 collection tests + 368 others)
- ✅ Live tested collections creation with dry_run: false
- ✅ Collections created successfully: 11 movies + 6 TV shows

**Problem Fixed:**
- Collection manager stored dry_run as a field at construction time
- Config hot-reload updated in-memory config but collections kept old dry_run value
- Collections always operated in the mode set at startup, ignoring config changes
- User reported collections not being created despite dry_run: false in config

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Dynamic Config Reading**:
   - Removed `dryRun bool` field from `JellyfinCollectionManager`
   - Added runtime config reads: `cfg := config.Get(); dryRun := cfg.App.DryRun`
   - Safety default: `dryRun = true` when config is nil (prevents accidental operations)
   - Applied to both `SyncCollections()` and `syncCollection()` methods

2. **Test Safety Improvements**:
   - Added `SetTestConfig(cfg *Config)` function to config package
   - Created `setupTestConfig(t)` helper for in-memory test configs
   - Tests no longer load prunarr.test.yaml (no live credentials)
   - 6 tests updated to use safe in-memory config

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `internal/config/config.go` (+6 lines) - Added SetTestConfig() for test injection
- `internal/services/jellyfin_collections.go` (~30 lines) - Dynamic config reading with nil safety
- `internal/services/sync.go` (-1 line) - Removed dryRun parameter from constructor
- `internal/services/jellyfin_collections_test.go` (+50 lines) - Safe test config setup

**Commits:**
1. `cfb4a68` - fix: make Jellyfin collections respect config hot-reload for dry_run setting

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (backend PID: 597610)
- Tests passing: 381/381 ✅
- Known issues: 1 movie (Red Dawn) missing Jellyfin ID (skipped from collections)
- Collections verified: ✅ Created successfully with 11 movies + 6 TV shows
- Config hot-reload: ✅ Working correctly for collections

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Collections deleted when empty (`hide_when_empty: true`)
- ✅ Collections created when items scheduled (retention changed to 10d)
- ✅ Logs show `dry_run: false` correctly applied
- ✅ Dynamic config reading works at runtime
- ✅ Safety default (dry_run=true) when config is nil

**Key Lessons:**
1. **State at construction vs runtime**: Values stored at construction time don't respect hot-reload
2. **Dynamic config reading**: Always read from `config.Get()` at runtime for hot-reload support
3. **Nil safety**: Always provide safe defaults when config might be nil
4. **Test isolation**: Never load real config files in tests - use in-memory configs
5. **ReapplyRetentionRules limitation**: Only re-evaluates retention, doesn't sync collections
6. **Full sync needed**: Collection changes require full sync, not just retention rule re-application

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Investigate "Red Dawn" missing Jellyfin ID (separate sync debugging)
- [ ] Consider adding collection sync to ReapplyRetentionRules() for faster UI updates
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking integration
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 18)

### Part 1: Scheduled Deletions Data Source Refactoring - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Resumed from Session 17 (auto-sync optimization completed)
- ✅ Refactored Scheduled Deletions page to query media API directly instead of job summaries
- ✅ Added config query to dynamically fetch dry-run mode
- ✅ Implemented client-side filtering for overdue items (deletion_date < now)
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing (380 test runs with subtests)

**Problem Identified:**
- Scheduled Deletions page was querying jobs endpoint (`would_delete` from job summaries)
- This created timing issues: empty → stale → correct data flow
- Confusing UX: delays between config changes and UI updates
- Different architecture from Library/Timeline pages (inconsistent)

**Decision Process:**
- Initially attempted to fix by populating `would_delete` in `ReapplyRetentionRules()`
- User correctly identified this was "too complex" and likely browser caching issue
- Chose **Option B**: Change to query media API directly (consistent with other pages)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed data source from `jobs` endpoint to `movies`/`shows` endpoints
- Added `config` query to fetch dry-run mode dynamically (replaced hardcoded TODO)
- Filter overdue items client-side: `deletion_date < now && !excluded && deletion_date != zero`
- Map `MediaItem → DeletionCandidate` on the fly with calculated `days_overdue`
- Benefits from Session 17's TanStack Query invalidation for immediate updates

**Why This is Better:**
1. **Consistent architecture** - All pages query media directly (Library, Timeline, Scheduled Deletions)
2. **Immediate updates** - Benefits from auto-invalidation after config/rule changes
3. **Simpler** - No dual data sources or complex job summary logic
4. **More accurate** - Always shows real-time state, not historical snapshots
5. **Eliminates lag** - No 60-second delay between config changes and UI updates

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/ScheduledDeletionsPage.tsx` (+70 lines, -17 lines) - Query media APIs, filter overdue, fetch dry-run from config

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing (380 test runs with subtests)
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully (hot-reload working)
- ✅ Manual API testing: 254 movies with valid deletion dates
- ✅ Config API returns dry_run mode correctly
- ✅ Media items have proper deletion_date fields with overdue calculations

### Part 2: Sync Scheduler Auto-Start Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed sync scheduler not starting automatically on backend startup
- ✅ Added `StartScheduler()` call to main.go when `sync.auto_start: true`
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing

**Problem Identified:**
- `sync.auto_start: true` in config but scheduler never started
- User had to manually trigger syncs via UI
- Scheduler initialization code existed but was never called

**Solution:**
- Added scheduler initialization in main.go after service setup
- Checks `config.Sync.AutoStart` before starting
- Logs "Sync scheduler started" when enabled
- Logs "Sync scheduler disabled" when `auto_start: false`

**Commits:**
2. `5b3cefa` - fix: ensure sync scheduler starts automatically when auto_start is enabled

### Part 3: Retention Rules Investigation - RESOLVED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Investigated user report: retention rule changes didn't update Dashboard/Timeline
- ✅ Added debug logging to rules engine and config reload
- ✅ Verified system working correctly end-to-end
- ✅ Identified file watcher limitation with `sed -i` edits
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing

**Problem Reported:**
- User changed retention from `10d` to `0d` via Configuration UI
- Dashboard and Timeline pages still showed old data with `10d` retention
- Expected immediate update (from Session 17's auto-refresh feature)

**Investigation Results:**
- ✅ Config hot-reload works correctly (`config.Get()` returns updated values)
- ✅ Rules engine uses correct retention values from config
- ✅ Auto-sync triggers within 1-2 seconds after config API update (Session 17 feature)
- ✅ TanStack Query invalidation triggers UI refresh (Session 17 feature)
- ✅ Debug logs confirm: `use_global: true`, retention values match config file

**Root Cause Identified:**
- **SYSTEM IS WORKING AS DESIGNED** ✅
- Issue likely: Browser cache or user checked UI before auto-sync completed (~1-2s delay)
- File watcher limitation discovered: `sed -i` doesn't trigger fsnotify (creates new file)
- **Workaround**: Use config API endpoint for updates (works perfectly)

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/services/rules.go` (+9 lines) - Debug logging at rules evaluation
- `internal/config/config.go` (+4 lines) - Enhanced config reload logging

**Commits:**
3. `2c3a67e` - debug: add retention policy logging for troubleshooting

**Testing Evidence:**
- Manual test: `0d` retention → 0 scheduled deletions (correct)
- Manual test: `10d` retention → 359 scheduled deletions (correct)
- Manual test: `5d` retention → Rules engine evaluates with `5d` values (correct)
- Leaving-soon API: 18 items with "10d" in deletion reasons (correct)
- Auto-sync triggered within 1 second after config API updates (correct)

### Part 4: Frontend Cache Issue Resolution - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Investigated user report: Frontend showing 359 items despite 0d retention
- ✅ Identified dual-cause issue: Frontend cache + backend stale in-memory data
- ✅ Fixed TanStack Query configuration (refetchOnWindowFocus)
- ✅ Restarted backend with fresh sync after retention changes
- ✅ All 381 test runs passing

**Problem Identified:**
- User reported frontend showing **359 scheduled deletions** despite config set to `0d` retention
- Backend API correctly returned **1-2 items** (tag rule exceptions only)
- Root causes:
  1. **Frontend**: `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` prevented automatic cache refresh
  2. **Backend**: Old process had in-memory data from previous higher retention

**Investigation Process:**
- Verified backend APIs working correctly (leaving-soon: 1 item, config: 0d retention)
- Identified TanStack Query cache showing stale data
- Discovered backend process started before retention changes (still had old in-memory cache)
- Config hot-reload updates config but doesn't re-evaluate existing media

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Frontend Fix** (`web/src/App.tsx`):
   - Changed `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` → `true`
   - Added `staleTime: 30000` (30 seconds)
   - Enables automatic refetch when switching browser tabs
   - Improves cross-tab synchronization

2. **Backend Fix**:
   - Stopped old backend process (PID 473594)
   - Rebuilt binary: `go build -o prunarr-test`
   - Started fresh backend (PID 491951) with clean sync
   - Full sync completed: 0 scheduled deletions (correct!)

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/App.tsx` (+2 lines, -1 line) - QueryClient refetch configuration

**Commits:**
4. `25b7711` - fix: enable refetchOnWindowFocus for cross-tab query updates

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 381 test runs passing (109 test functions)
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully (442.24 kB, gzipped: 131.24 kB)
- ✅ Backend API: Leaving-soon returns 1 item (tag rule exception)
- ✅ Backend API: Movies endpoint shows 1 scheduled deletion
- ✅ Config API: Returns 0d retention correctly
- ✅ Full sync: 255 movies, 123 TV shows, 0 standard deletions

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (backend PID 491951 + frontend dev server)
- Tests passing: 109/109 functions ✅ (381 test runs with subtests)
- Known issues: None

### Part 5: Dashboard "Leaving Soon" Navigation Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed Dashboard "Leaving Soon" section "View All" button navigation
- ✅ Changed navigation from `/scheduled-deletions` to `/timeline` (correct page)
- ✅ Changed button condition from `scheduledDeletionsCount` to `leavingSoon.total`
- ✅ All tests still passing (381 test runs)

**Problem Identified:**
- Dashboard "Leaving Soon" section shows future deletions (8 items)
- "View All" button incorrectly navigated to `/scheduled-deletions` (overdue items)
- Button condition used wrong count: `scheduledDeletionsCount` (368) instead of `leavingSoon.total` (8)
- Semantic mismatch: leaving-soon section should link to Timeline page

**Root Cause:**
- Code location: `web/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` lines 216-223
- Button used `scheduledDeletionsCount > 10` check (wrong metric)
- Button navigated to wrong page for the data being displayed
- Dashboard has two distinct sections:
  - **Scheduled Deletions Card**: Overdue items → `/scheduled-deletions` ✅
  - **Leaving Soon Section**: Future items → `/timeline` ✅ (NOW FIXED)

**Solution Implemented:**
```typescript
// OLD: Wrong navigation and count
{scheduledDeletionsCount > 10 && (
  <Button onClick={() => navigate('/scheduled-deletions')}>
    View All {scheduledDeletionsCount} Items
  </Button>
)}

// NEW: Correct navigation to Timeline
{leavingSoon.total > 10 && (
  <Button onClick={() => navigate('/timeline')}>
    View All {leavingSoon.total} Items
  </Button>
)}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` (3 lines changed) - Fixed button navigation and count

**Commits:**
5. `a2d378c` - fix: correct Dashboard 'Leaving Soon' button to navigate to Timeline page

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All tests passing (cached)
- ✅ Frontend hot-reloaded successfully
- ✅ Button now shows correct count (8 items)
- ✅ Button navigates to correct page (Timeline)
- ✅ Button condition uses correct metric (leavingSoon.total)

**Page Navigation Map (Corrected):**
| Dashboard Section | Data Type | Count | Navigates To |
|-------------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Scheduled Deletions Card | Overdue (`deletion_date < now`) | 368 | `/scheduled-deletions` ✅ |
| Leaving Soon Section | Future (`deletion_date > now`) | 8 | `/timeline` ✅ (FIXED) |

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (backend PID 528481 + frontend dev server)
- Tests passing: 109/109 functions ✅ (381 test runs with subtests)
- Known issues: None
- Session 18: COMPLETE ✅ (Parts 1-5)

**Key Lessons:**
1. **In-memory state matters**: Config hot-reload updates config but doesn't re-evaluate existing data
2. **Process restart needed**: When testing retention changes, restart backend for clean slate
3. **TanStack Query defaults**: `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` is too aggressive for multi-tab apps
4. **Cross-component invalidation**: Query invalidation only works for active queries or with refetchOnWindowFocus
5. **Debug logging value**: Helps verify system behavior during troubleshooting
6. **File watcher caveat**: `sed -i` creates new files, breaking fsnotify watch
7. **API-first approach**: Config API endpoint more reliable than direct file edits
8. **System integrity**: Sessions 13 + 17 features working correctly together
9. **Navigation consistency**: Each dashboard section should link to the page showing the same data type
10. **Button conditions**: UI controls should use the metric from the section they're in, not unrelated counts

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking integration
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends
- [ ] Consider file watcher improvements (detect file replacement vs modification)
- [ ] Consider adding "Refresh Data" button in UI for manual cache clearing

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 17)

### Part 1: Config Auto-Sync Performance Optimization - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Resumed from Session 16 (tag-based rules UI completed)
- ✅ User identified inefficiency in auto-sync behavior
- ✅ Optimized config updates to use `ReapplyRetentionRules()` instead of `FullSync()`
- ✅ Removed unused `context` import from config handler
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing (380 test runs with subtests)

**Problem Identified:**
- Session 13 implemented auto-sync on config changes using `FullSync()`
- `FullSync()` re-fetches ALL data from Radarr/Sonarr/Jellyfin (~12 seconds)
- When only retention rules change, no external data fetch needed
- Inefficient: causing unnecessary API calls and slower updates

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed config handler to call `ReapplyRetentionRules()` instead of `FullSync()`
- `ReapplyRetentionRules()` only re-evaluates existing in-memory media (instant)
- No external API calls needed for rule-only changes
- Deletion dates update within 1-2 seconds after config save
- Rules engine already uses global config (hot-reload support from Session 13)

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/api/handlers/config.go` (-5 lines net) - Use `ReapplyRetentionRules()`, remove unused import

**Commits:**
1. `f845a21` - perf: optimize config updates to use ReapplyRetentionRules instead of FullSync

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing
- ✅ Manual testing: Changed tag rule retention 90d → 1d → 365d via API
- ✅ Deletion dates updated correctly: May 31, 2025 → May 31, 2025 (overdue) → May 30, 2026
- ✅ No external API calls observed in logs (verified with Radarr/Sonarr/Jellyfin grep)
- ✅ Update time: ~1-2 seconds (was ~12 seconds with FullSync)
- ✅ Log message confirms: "Re-applying retention rules to existing media (no external API calls needed)"

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before**: Config update → FullSync → Re-fetch all data (~12s)
- **After**: Config update → ReapplyRetentionRules → Re-evaluate in-memory (~instant)
- **Improvement**: ~12x faster for rule-only changes

### Part 2: Automatic UI Refresh After Config Changes - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Added TanStack Query invalidation for media queries after config/rule updates
- ✅ ConfigurationPage now auto-refreshes UI after saving changes
- ✅ RulesPage now auto-refreshes UI after create/update/delete/toggle operations
- ✅ All tests passing (109 test functions)

**Problem Identified:**
- Backend re-applied retention rules instantly via `ReapplyRetentionRules()`
- Config/rules saved successfully with toast notification
- **Gap**: Frontend didn't know media data changed
- UI showed stale deletion dates until manual page refresh
- Poor UX: changes appeared to work but UI didn't reflect them

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` calls for media-related queries
- Invalidated query keys: `movies`, `shows`, `leaving-soon`, `leaving-soon-all`, `jobs`
- ConfigurationPage: Invalidates on successful config update
- RulesPage: Invalidates on create/update/delete/toggle success
- TanStack Query automatically refetches invalidated queries that are currently in use
- Open pages (Library, Timeline, Scheduled Deletions) auto-update within 1-2 seconds

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/ConfigurationPage.tsx` (+4 lines) - Added media query invalidations
- `web/src/pages/RulesPage.tsx` (+20 lines) - Added media query invalidations to all 4 mutations

**Commits:**
2. `dfd87b4` - feat: add automatic UI refresh after config and rule changes

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 109 test functions passing
- ✅ Frontend built successfully (441.28 kB, gzipped: 130.98 kB)
- ✅ Manual API testing: Config update 0d → 365d → 1d
- ✅ Leaving-soon count updated correctly: 0 → 232 → 1 items
- ✅ Advanced rule create/delete tested successfully
- ✅ No external API calls during re-apply (verified in logs)

**How It Works:**
1. User saves config/rule via UI
2. Backend receives request → Updates config → Calls `ReapplyRetentionRules()` (~1-2s)
3. Frontend mutation succeeds → Invalidates media queries
4. TanStack Query marks queries as stale
5. All active pages (Library/Timeline/Scheduled Deletions) automatically refetch
6. UI updates with new deletion dates within 1-2 seconds
7. User sees changes immediately without manual refresh

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (PID: 388993)
- Tests passing: 109/109 functions ✅ (380 test runs with subtests)
- Known issues: None
- Config auto-sync: Optimized ✅
- UI auto-refresh: Implemented ✅
- Session 17: COMPLETE ✅

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Consider reducing duplicate triggers (API handler + file watcher both call ReapplyRetentionRules)
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking integration
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 16)

### Tag-Based Rules UI Enhancements - COMPLETED ✅

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Added 17 comprehensive unit tests for tag-based rule evaluation
- ✅ Fixed 2 build errors (unused variables) and 2 test failures (incorrect expectations)
- ✅ Displayed tags on media cards across all three pages (Library, Scheduled Deletions, Timeline)
- ✅ Added tag filter to Library page with multi-select and clear functionality
- ✅ Added rule type badges showing which rule matched (Tag/User/Standard)
- ✅ All 380 test runs passing (was 111 test functions)

**Problem Solved:**
- No unit test coverage for tag-based rule logic
- Tags were stored in backend but not visible in UI
- No way to filter library by tags
- Users couldn't see which retention rule caused a deletion

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive test suite in `internal/services/rules_test.go` with 17 test cases
- Fixed test expectations: Tag rules DO override requested status when advanced rules exist
- Added `tags?: string[]` to TypeScript interfaces (MediaItem, DeletionCandidate)
- Display tags as secondary badges below title on all media cards
- Tag filter with active state, sorted alphabetically, OR logic (match ANY selected tag)
- Created `getRuleType()` helper to parse deletion_reason strings
- Display rule type badges using shadcn/ui Badge component variants

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/services/rules_test.go` (+460 lines) - 17 new test cases
- `web/src/lib/types.ts` (+2 lines) - Tag fields
- `web/src/pages/LibraryPage.tsx` (+99 lines) - Tags display + filter + rule badges
- `web/src/pages/ScheduledDeletionsPage.tsx` (+33 lines) - Tags display + rule badges
- `web/src/pages/TimelinePage.tsx` (+9 lines) - Tags display

**Commits:**
1. `02818b2` - test: add comprehensive unit tests for tag-based rule evaluation
2. `2923395` - feat: display tags on media cards across all pages
3. `cb2a3f1` - feat: add tag filter to Library page
4. `33d5997` - feat: display rule type badges on media cards

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 380 test runs passing (17 new test cases added)
- ✅ Services test coverage increased
- ✅ Frontend built successfully (440.18 kB, gzipped: 130.93 kB)
- ✅ Tags display correctly on all pages
- ✅ Tag filter works with multi-select and clear
- ✅ Rule type badges show correct rule that matched

**Rule Type Detection:**
- Tag rules: `"tag rule 'NAME' (tag: TAG) retention expired (RETENTION)"`
- User rules: `"user rule 'NAME' retention expired (RETENTION)"`
- Standard rules: `"retention period expired (RETENTION)"` or `"within retention"`

**UI Features Added:**
- Tag badges on media cards (secondary variant, flex-wrap gap-1)
- Tag filter buttons above sort controls (toggleable, multi-select)
- "Clear filters" button when tags selected
- Rule type badges next to media type (Tag Rule: default, User Rule: secondary, Standard: outline)
- Filter resets pagination automatically

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (PID: 287868)
- Tests passing: 380/380 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Tag-based rules: Fully implemented with UI ✅
- Session 16: COMPLETE ✅

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking integration
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

## Previous Session: Nov 4, 2025 (Session 14)

### Scheduled Deletions UI Bug Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Problem Identified:**
- Scheduled Deletions page was showing 0 items despite having 23-50 deletion candidates in job history
- Root cause: `would_delete` array in job summaries was only populated when `dry_run: true`
- Frontend ScheduledDeletionsPage always expects this array (`latestJob.summary?.would_delete || []`)
- With `dry_run: false`, the array was never populated, causing empty UI

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `internal/services/sync.go` lines 295-298
- Removed `dry_run` condition check before populating `would_delete` array
- Now always populates `would_delete` when deletion candidates exist
- Added clarifying comment explaining purpose in both modes

**Code Change:**
```go
// Before (Session 9):
if e.config.App.DryRun && len(wouldDelete) > 0 {
    job.Summary["would_delete"] = wouldDelete
}

// After (Session 14):
// Always add deletion candidates to job summary for UI display
// In dry-run mode, these are candidates that would be deleted
// Otherwise, these are candidates that will be deleted (if enable_deletion is true)
if len(wouldDelete) > 0 {
    job.Summary["would_delete"] = wouldDelete
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/services/sync.go` - Removed dry_run condition, always populate would_delete array (~4 lines changed)

**Commits:**
- `ae06c16` - fix: always populate would_delete in job summary for Scheduled Deletions UI

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 111 backend tests passing
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Config verified safe mode (`dry_run: true`)
- ✅ Binary rebuilt and tested with real data

**Technical Discovery - Field Name Mapping:**
- Backend `Media.DeleteAfter` → JSON `deletion_date` → Frontend `MediaItem.deletion_date`
- Backend `Media.DaysUntilDue` → JSON `days_until_deletion` → Frontend `MediaItem.days_until_deletion`
- Job summary candidates use `delete_after` → Frontend `DeletionCandidate.delete_after`
- Overdue items (`now.After(media.DeleteAfter)`) go in `would_delete` array
- Future deletions (`DaysUntilDue > 0`) returned by `/api/media/leaving-soon` endpoint

**Current State:**
- Running: No (stopped after testing)
- Tests passing: 111/111 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Scheduled Deletions page: Fixed ✅

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

---

## Previous Session: Nov 3, 2025 (Session 13)

### Part 1: Toast Notifications UI - COMPLETED ✅

**Implementation**: Added modern toast notifications for user feedback
- Installed Sonner library (modern React toast notifications)
- Replaced placeholder use-toast hook with proper Sonner implementation
- Added Toaster component to App.tsx for rendering notifications
- Success and error toasts now display properly across all pages
- Positioned top-right with rich colors (green for success, red for errors)

**Problem Solved**:
- Configuration page save appeared to do nothing (no visual feedback)
- use-toast hook only logged to console for success messages
- Error messages used browser alert() which is poor UX
- Users had no indication that operations succeeded or failed

**Files Modified**:
- `web/src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Implemented Sonner toast API (~9 lines changed)
- `web/src/App.tsx` - Added Toaster component (+2 lines)

**Commits**: `bf5f735`

### Part 2: Auto-Sync on Config Change - COMPLETED ✅

**Implementation**: Config updates now automatically trigger full sync when retention rules change
- ConfigHandler now accepts SyncEngine dependency injection
- Detects changes to `movie_retention`, `tv_retention`, or `advanced_rules`
- Triggers async full sync after config reload to re-evaluate media
- Eliminates need for manual sync after config changes

**Problem Solved**:
- User changed retention rules from default to `0d` but still saw 248 items scheduled for deletion
- Config hot-reload updated in-memory config but didn't re-run rules engine
- Required manual full sync via UI to see changes take effect
- Poor UX: changes appeared to not work immediately

**Solution**:
- Added retention change detection in `UpdateConfig()` handler
- Runs `h.syncEngine.FullSync(ctx)` asynchronously in goroutine
- Uses `context.Background()` to avoid blocking HTTP response
- Comprehensive logging for tracking sync triggers and completion
- Changes take effect within 1-2 seconds automatically

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/api/handlers/config.go` (+42 lines, -4 lines) - Detection & trigger logic
- `internal/api/router.go` (+1 line, -1 line) - Pass SyncEngine dependency

**Commits**: `c3f3118`

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ All 111 backend tests still passing
- ✅ Manual testing successful (retention 0d → 365d/180d → 0d)
- ✅ Auto-sync triggered within 1 second after config save
- ✅ Leaving-soon count updated correctly (0 → 129 → 0 items)
- ✅ Logs confirm sync trigger and completion

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Data Source Hierarchy
1. **Media Library**: Radarr (movies) + Sonarr (TV shows) = SOLE source of truth
2. **Watch Data**: Jellyfin updates existing entries with play counts and timestamps
3. **Requests**: Jellyseerr tracks who requested what
4. **Watch History**: Jellystat provides detailed watch tracking per user

### Sync Strategy
- **Full Sync** (every 1 hour): Complete library refresh from all integrations
- **Incremental Sync** (every 15 minutes): Update changed items only
- **Exclusions**: Applied after sync but before retention rules
- **Flow**: Radarr/Sonarr → Jellyfin (watch data) → Jellyseerr (requests) → Apply exclusions → Apply rules → Sync collections

### File Structure
```
/app/
├── config/
│   └── prunarr.yaml          # Main configuration (hot-reload enabled)
├── data/
│   ├── exclusions.json       # User "Keep" exclusions
│   └── jobs.json             # Job history (circular buffer)
└── logs/
    └── prunarr.log           # Structured JSON logs
```

---

## Important Code Locations

### Backend Core
- **Sync Engine**: `internal/services/sync.go` - Orchestrates all integrations
- **Rules Engine**: `internal/services/rules.go` - Evaluates retention policies
- **Exclusions**: `internal/storage/exclusions.go` - Manages "Keep" functionality
- **Jobs**: `internal/storage/jobs.go` - Tracks sync/deletion history
- **API Handlers**: `internal/api/handlers/` - REST endpoints
- **Clients**: `internal/clients/` - External service integrations

### Frontend Core
- **API Client**: `web/src/lib/api.ts` - TanStack Query integration
- **Auth Store**: `web/src/store/auth.ts` - Zustand auth state
- **Pages**: `web/src/pages/` - Main UI views
- **Types**: `web/src/lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces

### Configuration
- **Example**: `config/prunarr.yaml.example` - Template with defaults
- **Test Config**: `config/prunarr.test.yaml` - Testing configuration
- **Validation**: `internal/config/validation.go` - Config checks

---

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start development (backend + frontend)
make dev

# Build production binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Test API endpoints
./test-api.sh
```

### Testing Against Real Services
```bash
# Use test config with real Jellyfin/Radarr/Sonarr
./prunarr-test --config config/prunarr.test.yaml

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/prunarr-debug.log

# Access UI
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Common Tasks
1. **Add new API endpoint**: Create handler in `internal/api/handlers/`, add route to `internal/api/router.go`
2. **Add new integration**: Create client in `internal/clients/`, integrate into `internal/services/sync.go`
3. **Add new UI page**: Create component in `web/src/pages/`, add route to `web/src/App.tsx`
4. **Modify sync logic**: Edit `internal/services/sync.go`, ensure `applyExclusions()` runs before `applyRetentionRules()`

---

## Known Issues & Gotchas

### Backend
1. **Exclusions must persist through syncs**: Always call `applyExclusions()` in `FullSync()` before `applyRetentionRules()`
2. **Source of truth**: Never create media entries from Jellyfin - only Radarr/Sonarr
3. **Zero values**: Go's zero time (`0001-01-01`) requires special handling in JSON responses
4. **File sizes**: Only trust `SizeOnDisk` from Radarr/Sonarr, not Jellyfin

### Frontend
1. **Null safety**: Always provide default empty arrays in API responses (`response.items || []`)
2. **Date validation**: Filter out zero dates before displaying
3. **File size display**: Handle zero bytes gracefully ("Unknown" instead of "0.00 GB")
4. **Auth bypass**: Only use `admin.disable_auth: true` for local development

---

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests
- **Unit tests**: `*_test.go` files alongside source
- **Coverage targets**: >80% for handlers, >90% for storage
- **Run**: `go test ./... -v -cover`

### Frontend Tests
- **Manual testing**: Use test-api.sh to verify endpoints
- **Browser testing**: Check all pages in dev mode
- **Run dev**: `cd web && npm run dev`

### Integration Tests
- **Real services**: Test against actual Jellyfin/Radarr/Sonarr
- **Debug logging**: Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in config
- **Dry-run first**: Always test with `app.dry_run: true`

---

## Configuration Examples

### Minimal Config
```yaml
admin:
  username: admin

## Debug Tips

### Backend Debugging
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run with config flag
./prunarr --config config/prunarr.test.yaml

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/prunarr-debug.log | jq
```

### Frontend Debugging
```bash
# Check API responses
curl http://localhost:8080/api/dashboard/stats | jq

# Test with auth disabled (config: disable_auth: true)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/media/movies | jq

# Check browser console for errors
```

### Common Errors
1. **"Unauthorized"**: Check JWT token or enable `disable_auth`
2. **"Media not found"**: Verify Radarr/Sonarr sync completed
3. **Empty library**: Check integration URLs and API keys
4. **Exclusions not persisting**: Ensure `applyExclusions()` is called in sync

## Important Notes for AI Agents

### When Resuming Work
1. **Read this file first** to understand current state
2. **Check PRUNARR_SPEC.md** for detailed architecture
3. **Review recent commits** (`git log --oneline -10`)
4. **Check test coverage** (`make test`)

### When Making Changes
1. **Always run tests** after backend changes
2. **Preserve exclusions** - Never break `applyExclusions()` logic
3. **Maintain data source hierarchy** - Radarr/Sonarr = truth, Jellyfin = watch data only
4. **Update this file** when completing major features
5. **Document in PRUNARR_SPEC.md** when fixing bugs or adding features

### When Debugging
1. **Enable debug logging** (`LOG_LEVEL=debug`)
2. **Use test config** with real services

## Last Session: Nov 3, 2025 (Session 13 - UI Polish & Auto-Sync ✅)

### Part 1: Toast Notifications UI

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Resumed from Session 12 summary (config YAML serialization was fixed)
- ✅ Identified missing toast notifications in UI (use-toast hook was placeholder)
- ✅ Installed Sonner library for modern toast notifications
- ✅ Implemented proper toast notifications using Sonner
- ✅ Added Toaster component to App.tsx for rendering toasts
- ✅ Fixed use-toast hook to use Sonner instead of console.log/alert

**Problem Fixed:**
- Configuration page save appeared to do nothing (no user feedback)
- use-toast hook only logged to console for success messages
- Error messages used browser alert() which is poor UX
- No toast component existed in the UI to render notifications

**Solution:**
- Installed `sonner` npm package (modern React toast library)
- Updated `use-toast.ts` to call `sonnerToast.success()` and `sonnerToast.error()`
- Added `<Toaster position="top-right" richColors />` to App.tsx
- Vite hot-reload automatically picked up changes (no restart needed)

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `web/src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Replaced console.log/alert with Sonner toast API (~9 lines changed)
- `web/src/App.tsx` - Added Toaster import and component (+2 lines)

**Commits:**
1. `bf5f735` - feat: add Sonner toast notifications for user feedback

### Part 2: Auto-Sync on Retention Rule Changes

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Identified UX issue: config changes didn't take effect until manual sync
- ✅ Added SyncEngine dependency to ConfigHandler
- ✅ Implemented retention rule change detection
- ✅ Added async full sync trigger after config updates
- ✅ All 111 backend tests still passing

**Problem Fixed:**
- User changed retention rules from defaults to `0d` but still saw 248 items scheduled for deletion
- Config hot-reload updated in-memory config but didn't re-run rules engine
- Required manual full sync via UI to see changes take effect
- Poor UX: changes appeared to not work immediately

**Solution:**
- ConfigHandler now accepts `SyncEngine` dependency injection
- `UpdateConfig()` detects changes to `movie_retention`, `tv_retention`, or `advanced_rules`
- Triggers `h.syncEngine.FullSync(ctx)` asynchronously in goroutine after config reload
- Uses `context.Background()` to avoid blocking HTTP response
- Comprehensive logging tracks retention changes, sync triggers, and completion

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `internal/api/handlers/config.go` (+42 lines, -4 lines) - Detection & trigger logic
- `internal/api/router.go` (+1 line, -1 line) - Pass SyncEngine dependency

**Commits:**
2. `c3f3118` - feat: auto-trigger full sync when retention rules change in config

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (backend + frontend dev server)
- Tests passing: 111/111 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Toast notifications: Working ✅
- Auto-sync on config change: Working ✅
- Frontend build: 437.92 kB (gzipped: 130.28 kB)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Manual test: Changed retention from 0d → 365d/180d via Configuration page
- ✅ Auto-sync triggered within 1 second (logged: "Triggering full sync to re-apply retention rules")
- ✅ Leaving-soon count updated correctly: 0 → 129 items
- ✅ Manual test: Changed retention back to 0d
- ✅ Auto-sync triggered again, leaving-soon count: 129 → 0 items
- ✅ Full sync completes in ~1 second for 378 media items

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Manual UI testing: Verify Configuration page shows toast + auto-sync behavior end-to-end
- [ ] Manual UI testing: Advanced Rules page (create/edit/delete rules)
- [ ] Consider Sessions 10-13 (Config UI + Rules UI + Toast + Auto-Sync) COMPLETE
- [ ] Move to next feature: mobile responsiveness or user-based cleanup
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends

**Key Lessons:**
- **Sonner**: Modern standard for React toast notifications, works great with shadcn/ui
- **Auto-sync**: Retention rule changes should trigger immediate re-evaluation for better UX
- **Async operations**: Use goroutines for sync to avoid blocking HTTP responses
- **Context**: Use `context.Background()` for background tasks, not request contexts

## Previous Session: Nov 3, 2025 (Session 12 - Config YAML Serialization Bug Fix ✅)

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Resumed from Session 11 summary (identified YAML serialization bug)
- ✅ Fixed malformed YAML field names by adding `yaml` tags to all config structs
- ✅ Fixed directory path extraction using `filepath.Dir()` instead of hardcoded string trimming
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging for config write operations
- ✅ Added `GetPath()` function to retrieve current config file path
- ✅ Fixed ConfigurationPage `useEffect` hook for proper form initialization
- ✅ All 111 tests still passing
- ✅ Config update API now works end-to-end

**Problem Fixed:**
- Config update endpoint was writing malformed YAML with incorrect field names
- Example: `dryrun` instead of `dry_run`, `disableauth` instead of `disable_auth`
- Root cause: Missing `yaml` tags on Go struct fields (only had `mapstructure` and `json` tags)
- Impact: Config reload validation failures after API updates

**Solution:**
- Added `yaml:"field_name"` tags to all 14 config struct types (types.go)
- Used `yaml:",inline"` for embedded `BaseIntegrationConfig` structs
- Used `yaml:",omitempty"` for optional fields (advanced_rules, user rules)
- All fields now have triple tags: `mapstructure:"name" yaml:"name" json:"name"`

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `internal/config/types.go` - Added `yaml` tags to all 14 config struct types (~60 lines changed)
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added `GetPath()` function (+5 lines)
- `internal/api/handlers/config.go` - Fixed directory handling, added debug logging (~23 lines changed)
- `web/src/pages/ConfigurationPage.tsx` - Fixed `useEffect` hook (changed from `useState` to `useEffect`)

**Commits:**
1. `e47330c` - fix: add YAML tags for proper config file serialization and improve write logging

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (backend + frontend dev server)
- Tests passing: 111/111 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Config update: Working end-to-end ✅
- YAML serialization: Correct snake_case field names ✅

**Technical Details:**

**Config Handler Improvements:**
- `writeConfigToFile()` now uses `filepath.Dir(configPath)` to extract directory path
- Added 7 new log statements for debugging config write operations:
  - "About to write config to file" (with leaving_soon_days value)
  - "Writing config to file" (with path)
  - "Ensuring directory exists" (with dir path)
  - "Writing file" (with path and byte count)
  - "Config file written successfully"
  - "Write config completed successfully"
  - Error logs for marshal, mkdir, and write failures

**Verification Tests:**
- ✅ `GET /api/config` returns correct JSON with snake_case fields
- ✅ `PUT /api/config` updates file with correct YAML field names
- ✅ Updated config values reflected immediately via API
- ✅ No more validation errors on config reload
- ✅ All integration settings preserved correctly

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Manual UI testing: Configuration page form (load/save)
- [ ] Manual UI testing: Advanced Rules page (create/edit/delete)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends
- [ ] User-based cleanup with watch tracking

**Key Lesson:**
- Go structs used for YAML marshaling require explicit `yaml` tags
- Without `yaml` tags, Go uses field names directly (e.g., `DryRun` becomes `dryrun`)
- Triple tags pattern ensures correct serialization across all formats: `mapstructure:"x" yaml:"x" json:"x"`

- ✅ GET /api/rules lists existing rules
- ✅ POST /api/rules creates new rule (requires capitalized JSON keys: Name, Type, etc.)
- ✅ PATCH /api/rules/{name}/toggle requires JSON body: `{"enabled": true/false}`
- ✅ DELETE /api/rules/{name} removes rule and reloads config
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
- ✅ Frontend build successful (404.18 kB)

- Known issues: None
- Test coverage: Handlers 89.0%, Storage 92.7%, Services 58.3%, Clients 5.8%
- Total test functions: 106 (up from 97)

**Feature Implementation:**
- **Config default:** `enable_deletion: false` (manual-only mode by default)
- **Automatic deletion:** Requires both `enable_deletion: true` AND `dry_run: false`
- **Manual deletion:** Available via `POST /api/deletions/execute` endpoint
- **Safety layers:** Config flag + dry-run check + UI confirmation dialog

## Previous Session: Nov 3, 2025 (Session 8 - Collection Manager Tests & Bug Fix ✅)

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Task #1 COMPLETE: Added comprehensive unit tests for `JellyfinCollectionManager`
- ✅ Task #2 COMPLETE: Verified `hide_when_empty` behavior via unit tests
- ✅ Task #3 COMPLETE: Fixed TV show type bug (collections now properly include TV shows)

**Files Modified & Committed:**
- `internal/services/jellyfin_collections.go` - Added interface, fixed media type comparison (+12/-4 lines)
- `internal/services/jellyfin_collections_test.go` - NEW: 484 lines, 13 comprehensive test cases

**Commits:**
1. `cb0239b` - test: add comprehensive tests for Jellyfin collection manager and fix TV show type bug

**Current State:**
- Running: No
- Tests passing: 97/97 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Test coverage: Handlers 89.0%, Storage 92.7%, Services 58.3%, Clients 5.8%

**Test Cases Added:**
1. `TestNewJellyfinCollectionManager` - Constructor validation
2. `TestSyncCollections_Disabled` - Skip when disabled
3. `TestSyncCollections_CreateMovieCollection` - Create movie collections
4. `TestSyncCollections_CreateTVShowCollection` - Create TV show collections
5. `TestSyncCollections_SeparatesByType` - Movies and TV shows separated
6. `TestSyncCollections_SkipsExcludedItems` - Excluded items not added
7. `TestSyncCollections_SkipsItemsWithoutJellyfinID` - Missing IDs skipped
8. `TestSyncCollections_SkipsPastDeletionDates` - Past dates filtered
9. `TestSyncCollections_DeletesEmptyCollectionWithHideWhenEmpty` - Auto-delete empty
10. `TestSyncCollections_KeepsEmptyCollectionWithoutHideWhenEmpty` - Keep empty
11. `TestSyncCollections_UpdatesExistingCollection` - Update existing
12. `TestSyncCollections_DryRunMode` - Dry-run behavior
13. `TestSyncCollection_EmptyName` - Edge case handling

**Bug Fixed:**
- **Root Cause**: Collection manager checked `media.Type == "show"` but models use `MediaTypeTVShow = "tv_show"`
- **Impact**: TV shows were never added to collections (always 0 items)
- **Fix**: Changed to use `models.MediaTypeMovie` and `models.MediaTypeTVShow` constants
- **Verification**: Unit test `TestSyncCollections_CreateTVShowCollection` now passes

**Interface Design:**
- Created `JellyfinCollectionClient` interface with 4 methods:
  - `GetCollectionByName(ctx, name) (*JellyfinCollection, error)`
  - `CreateCollection(ctx, name, itemIDs, dryRun) (string, error)`
  - `AddItemsToCollection(ctx, collectionID, itemIDs, dryRun) error`
  - `DeleteCollection(ctx, collectionID, dryRun) error`
- Allows mock clients for unit testing
- Follows Go best practices for dependency injection

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Configuration UI page (edit prunarr.yaml via web)
- [ ] Advanced rules UI (user-based rules editor)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends

- `hide_when_empty: true` - Auto-delete collection when no items scheduled
- Debug logging for all collection operations
- Graceful error handling (doesn't fail entire sync)
- Filters: non-excluded items, with future deletion dates, with valid Jellyfin IDs

---

## Previous Session: Nov 3, 2025 (Session 6 - Semantic Date Labels)

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Resumed from Session 5 (requester info feature was complete)
- ✅ Verified frontend properly handles missing requester data (no changes needed)
- ✅ Fixed zero date display bug (Go's `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` showing as "Jan 1, 1")
- ✅ Implemented semantic date labels for better UX clarity
- ✅ Added context-aware `formatDate()` function to all three pages
- ✅ All 282 tests still passing

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/LibraryPage.tsx` - Added context parameter to formatDate(), semantic labels
- `web/src/pages/ScheduledDeletionsPage.tsx` - Added context parameter, semantic labels  
- `web/src/pages/TimelinePage.tsx` - Changed "Unknown" → "N/A" for deletion dates

**Commits:**
1. `08a28b7` - fix: handle zero date values (0001-01-01) in Library and Timeline pages
2. `6bd6305` - fix: use semantic date labels (N/A for deletions, Never/Unknown for watched)

**Current State:**
- Running: Yes (Prunarr + Frontend dev server)
- Tests passing: 282/282 ✅
- Known issues: None
- Media tracked: 378 items (255 movies, 123 TV shows)
- Items with zero dates: 84 movies with zero last_watched, 5 deletions with zero last_watched

**Date Label Semantics (User Clarity):**
- **"Never"** (watched context) - Item hasn't been watched yet
- **"N/A"** (deletion context) - No deletion scheduled (doesn't imply exclusion/exemption)
- **"Unknown"** (scheduled deletions) - Generic unknown value for watched dates
- **"Not scheduled"** (library page) - When deletion_date is null/undefined

**Implementation Details:**
- `formatDate(dateStr, context: 'watched' | 'deletion')` - Context-aware formatting
- Zero date detection: `getFullYear() <= 1970 && getMonth() === 0 && getDate() === 1`
- Library Page: Uses both contexts (watched for last_watched, deletion for deletion_date)
- Scheduled Deletions: Uses both contexts (deletion for delete_after, watched for last_watched)
- Timeline Page: Only uses deletion context (filters out zero dates entirely)

**Next Session TODO:**
- [ ] Configuration UI page (allow editing prunarr.yaml via web)
- [ ] Collection management for "Leaving Soon" in Jellyfin
- [ ] Advanced rules UI (user-based rules editor)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Statistics/charts for disk space trends

3. `1b4d30d` - feat: add requester info to scheduled deletion candidates
4. `5b835f0` - docs: update AGENTS.md with session 5 summary

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Username fallback chain: DisplayName → JellyfinUsername → Username
- Job summary includes 4 requester fields: `is_requested`, `requested_by_user_id`, `requested_by_username`, `requested_by_email`
- Frontend conditionally shows requester only when `is_requested == true`
- Jellyseerr API uses `displayName` field (not `username`) for display names
